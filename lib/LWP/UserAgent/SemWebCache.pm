=head1 NAME

LWP::UserAgent::SemWebCache - LWP::UserAgent for caching SPARQL Queries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a slight modification of L<LWP::UserAgent::CHICaching>, and
can be used much like it:

  my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'Memory', global => 1 );
  my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::SemWebCache->new(cache => $cache);
  my $res1 = $ua->get("http://localhost:3000/?query=DAHUT");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class composes the two roles L<LWP::UserAgent::Role::CHICaching>
and L<LWP::UserAgent::Role::CHICaching::VaryNotAsterisk> and
reimplements the C<key> attribute.

For now, it makes a relatively uncertain assumption that could in some
cases violate L<Section 4.1 of
RFC7234|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.1> and cause
unpredictable results: Since SPARQL results come in different
serializations, the C<Vary> header will be present in most cases, and
therefore, different caches would usually have been required. However,
if we assume that no variations that are semantically significant
could occur, then we should be OK. Unless, of course, the server
declared that anything goes, which amount to setting C<Vary: *>, in
that case, we don't cache.

Additionally, since the URI resulting from a SPARQL protocol query
might be long, and long keys are often difficult for backend caches,
so the reimplementation of C<key> will create a digest.

=head2 Attributes and Methods

=over

=item C<< key >>, C<< clear_key >>

The key to use for a response. This role will return the canonical URI of the
request as a string, which is a reasonable default.
