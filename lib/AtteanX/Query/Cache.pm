=head1 NAME

AtteanX::Query::Cache - Experimental prefetching SPARQL query cacher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an alpha release of a system that is able to intercept SPARQL
queries if deployed in a proxy, and analyze the queries so that the
query can be evaluated on the proxy. It can look up in a cache on the
proxy, send parts of the query on to the remote endpoint, use Linked
Data Fragments when appropriate and so on. The analyzer may also
decide to prefetch certain data asynchronously.

It is known at present to have insufficient performance for any
practical use, but is released anyway as an alpha.
